SaveBox
=======

SaveBox is a terminal-style save manager for "Incursion Red River" and "The Forever Winter."
It allows players to save, load, delete, and wipe their save data manually through a simple
console interface. This can be useful for challenge runs, experimenting, or general save/load
management without having to manually copy files.

IMPORTANT
---------
This program is lightly tested. 
Please back up your save data separately before using SaveBox to avoid potential data loss.

How It Works
------------
- When launched, SaveBox scans for supported games on your system.
- For each game, you can:
  - Save your current progress under a custom name.
  - Load a previously saved snapshot.
  - Wipe your current save (optionally saving a backup first).
  - Delete an old snapshot.
- All interactions are done through a basic terminal (console window).

Supported Games
---------------
- Incursion Red River
- The Forever Winter
